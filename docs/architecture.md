# Architecture

## Host

The M920Q is the primary Homelab server.

```text
M920Q
├── Debian 13
├── Docker
├── Tailscale
├── /opt/homelab
└── /srv/homelab
```

## Repository

`/opt/homelab` contains rebuildable infrastructure:

- service definitions
- deployment scripts
- Docker configuration
- systemd units
- documentation

## Persistent data

`/srv/homelab` contains state that must survive repository rebuilds:

```text
/srv/homelab/
├── appdata/
├── media/
└── backups/
```

## Service model

Services are kept logically separate so individual applications can be deployed, updated, or recovered without turning the host into one monolithic configuration.

The exact Compose organization will be established as services are migrated.
